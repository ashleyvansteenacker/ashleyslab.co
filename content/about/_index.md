<p>Hi there! I'm <strong>Ashley</strong> I'm a maker / hobbyist.</p>
<p>Ever since I was little I always liked to take things appart and just try to figure out how things work. Now that I finaly have my own little workshop where I can tinker arround with electronics and 3D printers</p>


<h3>Education:</h3>
<p>I spend my highschool years at TechniGO (Aalst) both campus Ledebaan and Welvaartstaat.
starting at my 3th year, I deceded to follow the elctomechanics cource. And I loved it! 
</p>
<p>For college I wanted to give Industrial Product Design (IPO) at Howest a try. However I quickly discovered that Design is nothing for me. I'd rater have a bulky functional thing then a pretty paperweight</p>


<h3>What do I do in my daily life?</h3>
<p>I'm An electrician at <strong>Dyanco</strong>. I am responcible there to make sure all of our customers recieve working control boxes for their High Speed roll-up doors. Including ATEX!</p>

<p>I also coach kids at <a href="http://aalst.coderdojobelgium.be">CoderDojo in Aalst</a>. I coach Electronic related things like Arduino, Microbit, Codebug.</p>

<h3>Other awesome things?</h3>

<p>A while back I was invited to help with an Arduino workshop at Technopolis. Like how cool is that?</p>

<p>I also had a chance to talk at a HackBelgium meetup about a possible solution to bridge the gap when it comes to elder people and digital finace. </p>
